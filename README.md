# code-samples
A portfolio of my C# knowledge (mostly Unity API-focused).
I cannot claim all of this is completely original, in fact most of it is based on tutorials.
I never copy-pasted any code.
I can say that I understand how all of the code works and could recreate it all in a closed environment.



If the code or it's logic is from a tutorial, I've included the tutorial in the script's comments.
